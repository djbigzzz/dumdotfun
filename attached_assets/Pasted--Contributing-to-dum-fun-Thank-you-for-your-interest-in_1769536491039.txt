## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Privacy Integrations
If you're adding a new privacy integration:
1. Create a new file in `server/privacy/`
2. Export main functions with clear TypeScript types
3. Add error handling for all SDK calls
4. Update `/api/privacy/status` endpoint
5. Add documentation to README.md
6. Create tests if possible
