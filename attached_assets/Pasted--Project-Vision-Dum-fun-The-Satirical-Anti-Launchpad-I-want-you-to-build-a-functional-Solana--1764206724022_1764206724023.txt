# Project Vision: Dum.fun (The Satirical Anti-Launchpad)

I want you to build a functional Solana Meme Coin Launchpad that parodies the platform "Pump.fun".
Your goal is to focus heavily on the **Front-End Design, Animations, and User Experience**.
The backend (Rust/Solana) should be handled by you as needed to support the frontend.

## 1. The Aesthetic: "Neo-Brutalist Panic"
The site should look like a "dangerous" version of the internet from 1999 mixed with modern crypto degen culture.
* **Color Palette:** Black Background (`#000000`), High-Contrast Warning Red (`#FF0000`), Safety Yellow (`#FFFF00`), and Neon Green terminal text.
* **Typography:** Use a mix of Monospace fonts (like 'Courier New' or 'Space Mono') for data, and massive, blocky Sans-Serif fonts (like 'Impact' or 'Archivo Black') for headers.
* **Vibe:** Chaotic, urgent, and "broken." Things should jitter, flash, or look like error messages.

## 2. The Core User Journey (The "Race to Zero")
Replicate the 'Pump.fun' layout but invert the psychology.

### A. The Landing Page (The Dashboard)
* **Layout:** A chaotic grid of currently active token launches.
* **Card Design:** Instead of a clean card, each token looks like a "Wanted Poster" or a "System Error" window.
* **The "King of the Hill" Feature:**
    * On Pump.fun, the top coin is "King of the Hill."
    * **On Dum.fun:** The coin dropping the fastest is the **"Village Idiot."**
    * **Visual:** Place this coin at the top in a shaking, red-bordered box with a "CRASHING NOW" badge.
* **Animations:**
    * When a buy happens: Screen shakes slightly.
    * When a sell happens: A "glass crack" overlay appears briefly over the token card.

### B. The Token Detail Page (The Trading View)
* **The Chart:**
    * DO NOT show a standard TradingView candle chart.
    * Show a **"Doom Line"**: A thick red line that trends downwards by default.
    * When someone buys, the line "glitches" upward (a green spike) and then continues falling.
* **The Big Button:**
    * The "Buy" button should be massive and labeled **"CATCH THE KNIFE"**.
    * Hover effect: The button shakes as if it's unstable.
* **The Chat:**
    * Label it **"The Scream Chamber"**.
    * Style it like an old IRC chat or a hacked terminal.

### C. The Launch Flow (Creating a Coin)
* **The Button:** A floating button in the bottom right labeled **"START A DISASTER"**.
* **The Form:**
    * Keep it simple: Name, Ticker, Image.
    * **The Twist:** Add a "Warning" checkbox that users must click: *"I admit this is a terrible idea."*
    * **Success State:** When a coin launches, play a "siren" sound effect and flash the screen red.

## 3. Specific UI "Dum" Features
* **The Header:** Instead of a navigation bar, use a "Marquee" (scrolling text) that reads: *WARNING: YOU WILL LOSE MONEY • THIS IS FINANCIAL SUICIDE • HAVE FUN STAYING POOR*.
* **Wallet Connect:** When the user connects their Phantom wallet, change the button text to **"VICTIM [Wallet_Address]"**.
* **The "Refund" Button:** Place a small "Refund" link in the footer. If clicked, it should trigger a browser alert saying: *"LOL NO."*

## 4. Technical Instructions for You (The AI)
* **Frontend:** Use Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for the animations.
* **Backend:** Scaffold a basic Solana Anchor program that allows:
    1.  Creating a token (minting).
    2.  Buying tokens (bonding curve logic).
    3.  Selling tokens.
* **Mock Data:** For now, if you cannot connect to Devnet immediately, populate the dashboard with "Fake Live Data" so I can see the design and animations in action.
