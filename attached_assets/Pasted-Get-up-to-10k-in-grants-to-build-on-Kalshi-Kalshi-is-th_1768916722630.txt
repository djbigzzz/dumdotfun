Get up to $10k in grants to build on Kalshi 
Kalshi is the liquidity layer for on-chain prediction markets, enabling traders to buy and sell yes/no event contracts on real-world outcomes like elections, inflation, weather, and economic releases. Each contract’s price reflects the market’s probability of the event, allowing users to speculate or hedge against uncertainty with deep, global liquidity.

Kalshi recently launched Builder Codes, a new way for developers to permissionlessly monetize applications built on top of Kalshi’s markets. Builders integrating third party toolkits (such as DFlow and Jupiter) can earn up to 30% of fees generated by their users and can also charge additional fees on top.

The toolkits are API-based, with interactions settling on Solana and featuring built-in multi-token quoting and routing. No extra infrastructure or smart contracts are required to integrate prediction markets if you use Kalshi APIs — its possible to spin up MVPs in a couple of days.

To support this ecosystem, Kalshi is offering up to $10,000 in developer grants for teams building integrations, tools, and data experiences using its liquidity layer and API. If you’re creating anything powered by real-world event markets, this is the ideal opportunity to get funded while shipping something impactful.

Who can apply to the Builders Program? 
Anyone! Whether you're a developer, creator, researcher, or entrepreneur, if you have an idea for building on top of Kalshi's prediction markets, we want to hear from you.

What kind of projects are you looking for?
We're interested in a wide range of projects including trading bots, analytics dashboards, educational content, market-making tools, data visualizations, mobile apps, browser extensions, and any innovative use cases that leverage Kalshi's prediction markets.

How much funding can I receive?
Funding varies based on project scope, complexity, and potential impact. We offer flexible support ranging from small grants for individual developers to larger investments for team projects. Tell us about your project and we'll work with you to determine appropriate funding.

Do I need to be located in the United States?
No! The Builders Program is open to developers and creators worldwide. However, please note that access to trading on Kalshi itself may be subject to regional restrictions.

Can I apply with just an idea, or do I need a working prototype?
Both are welcome! We support builders at all stages, from early ideation to projects that are already live. Tell us about your vision and where you are in the development process.

What support does Kalshi provide beyond funding?
Builders get access to our engineering team for technical support, API priority access, marketing and social amplification, exclusive community access, and opportunities for partnership and collaboration with Kalshi.

Will I retain ownership of my project? 
Yes! You maintain full ownership and intellectual property rights to your project. We're here to support your success, not take ownership of your work.  

Will I receive feedback on my proposal?
Unfortunately, our sponsors receive tens of applications per week and will be unable to provide individualized feedback. Please keep that in mind before applying to avoid disappointment later.
