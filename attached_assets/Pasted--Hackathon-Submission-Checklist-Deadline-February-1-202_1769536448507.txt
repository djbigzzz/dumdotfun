## 🎬 Demo Video Script Template

### Intro (30 seconds)
```
"Hi! I'm [name], and I built dum.fun for the Solana Privacy Hack.

The problem: Blockchain payments are completely transparent.
Everyone can see your salary, your balance, your entire financial history.

dum.fun solves this by integrating 8 different privacy protocols
into a token launchpad with confidential prediction markets.

Let me show you how it works."
```

### Demo Flow (2 minutes)
1. **Connect wallet** → Show Phantom integration
2. **Airdrop Devnet SOL** → Click airdrop button
3. **Create a token** → Real SPL creation
4. **Enable privacy** → Open Privacy Hub
5. **Deposit to ShadowWire pool** → Show transaction
6. **Make private transfer** → Amount hidden on-chain
7. **Generate stealth address** → Show one-time address
8. **Create prediction market** → AI agent demo
9. **Place confidential bet** → Encrypted amount

### Technical Highlight (30 seconds)
```
"Under the hood, we're using:
- Bulletproofs for zero-knowledge proofs
- Token-2022 for confidential transfers
- Stealth addresses from Anoncoin
- Inco Lightning for encrypted betting
- And 4 more privacy protocols

All 8 integrations work together on Solana Devnet."
```

### Outro (30 seconds)
```
"dum.fun brings enterprise-grade privacy to Solana.
Our code is open source, MIT licensed, and ready for mainnet.

Check out the GitHub repo for docs and the technical deep-dive.

Thanks to Radr, Inco, Helius, and all our sponsors
for making this possible!"
```
